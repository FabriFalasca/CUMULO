# CUMULO

Code sourse of CUMULO, a benchmark dataset for training and evaluating global cloud classification models. 
It merges two satellite products from the [A-train constellation](https://atrain.nasa.gov/): 
the [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from Aqua satellite](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) and the [2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR product](http://www.cloudsat.cira.colostate.edu/data-products/level-2b/2b-cldclass-lidar) derived from the combination of CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and CALIPSO Cloud‚ÄêAerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP).
